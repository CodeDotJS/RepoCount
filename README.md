# Repository-Count
The worst way of writing a working javascript code to find user's total repositories, how many of them are forked and how many of them are genuine repositories.

---------------------------------------------

This repository used to work for all the users, as before, github use to show all the repository of the user on a siingle page. But now, github has changed this to "view more reporisotry". So, if you paste the code in console, you won't get the exact result.

NOTE : Now, maximum repository shown by github is 200, but before it was unlimited.
